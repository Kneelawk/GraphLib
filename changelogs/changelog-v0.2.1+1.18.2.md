# GraphLib v0.2.1+1.18.2

GraphLib version 0.2.1 for Minecraft 1.18.2

Changes:

* Catches many errors that would otherwise cause a server crash and logs them. I'm not quite sure if this is the best
  thing to do, but it is a kind of brute-force approach to stability.
* Adds some more info to existing null-check error logging.
